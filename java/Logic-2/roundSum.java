/*
For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit 
is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 
10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a b c, return 
the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper "public 
int round10(int num) {" and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the 
same indent level as roundSum().
*/

public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
  return round10(a) + round10(b) + round10(c); 
}

public int round10 (int num) {
  int rightmostDigit = num % 10;
  if(rightmostDigit >= 5) {
    return num  + (10 - rightmostDigit);
  }
  else {
    return num  - rightmostDigit;    
  }
